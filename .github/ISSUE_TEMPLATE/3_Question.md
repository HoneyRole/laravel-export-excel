Please use the Discussions tab (https://github.com/Maatwebsite/Laravel-Excel/discussions) to discuss your questions, please don't open a issue for it as we try to keep the issue tracker oriented at bugs. Questions that belongs in the Discussions tab WILL be closed.

When asking questions please try to keep your question generic. Pasting in a big chunk of your application-specific code is hard for use to reproduce and understand. When you need application specific help you can consider our commercial support (https://laravel-excel.com/commercial-support) or perhaps try Stackoverflow Or Laracasts.

Thanks!
