# Introduction

Laravel Excel is intended at being Laravel-flavoured PhpSpreadsheet: a simple, but elegant wrapper around PhpSpreadsheet with the goal of simplifying
exports. 

[PhpSpreadsheet](https://phpspreadsheet.readthedocs.io/) is a library written in pure PHP and providing a set of classes that allow you to read from and to write to different spreadsheet file formats, like Excel and LibreOffice Calc.

Laravel Excel features:

* Easily export collections to Excel
* Export queries with automatic chunking for better performance
* Queue exports for better performance
* Easily export Blade views to Excel
